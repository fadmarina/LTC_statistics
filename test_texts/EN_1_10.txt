Firms Urged to Provide Child Care for Staff
Child care costs about Â£6,000 a year for a family with two young children, more than the average family spends on housing or food, a report said yesterday.
The Daycare trust said care was more expensive in Britain than anywhere else in Europe and urged employers to provide more facilities for staff.
Under current arrangements there is only one registered child care place for every nine children under eight, even though employers rely heavily on mothers of dependent children.
The report said 35 per cent of women who did not return to work after giving birth gave as the main reason that they could not earn enough to pay for child care.
Two thirds of working mothers now returned after maternity leave, an increase of 59 per cent since 1988, and more than half of all mothers of under-fives were economically active.
The report said: "Employers need an effective child care infrastructure as much as they need roads and railways."
"However, Britain's child care infrastructure is weak and there is a shortage of high quality, affordable care places." By contrast most European countries have created arrangements to provide affordable child care places for families.
The report says publicly-funded day care is provided for two per cent of children under three in Britain compared with 48 per cent in Denmark and 20 per cent in France.
