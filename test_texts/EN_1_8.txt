Our romance with the car
Now that the car is a century old and its very existence is being questioned, how can anyone admit to a passion for a noisy lump of metal?
The answer is that the finest engines are like poems or pieces of sculpture - they should be admired for their logic, beauty, sound and performance. It is possible to admire an engine designed by people like Hassan, Royce or Porsche without even needing to see it move. If all the petrol in the world was used up, car enthusiasts would still look admiringly at a Hassan V12 because they know that it represents one of the great moments in mechanical engineering history.
The problem with the car, a century on, is that we have allowed Henry Ford and not Henry Royce (of Rolls-Royce fame) to be the winner. For the most part, the car is now an ugly, commonplace form of transport rather than a beautiful toy or exquisite work of engineering. Mass-market cars may be democratic, but with a few shining exceptions (the Mini; the Fiat 500; the Volkswagen 'Beetle') - the vast majority are about as inspiring as a dishwasher. They make the heart beat faster only when their drivers are about to crash into each other.
In most European countries cars have never really been a necessity. Although few car owners will admit it, they're a luxury. Owners say in defence of their Ford or Nissan that it gives them freedom; but it's a freedom (they do not admit this) to drive on crowded roads, to queue for car-parks, to develop high blood-pressure in motorway traffic jams.
Most driving in cars is, in fact, a chore, and yet we still have images of ourselves in sunglasses driving a jeep on an African safari, of beating the Formula 1 world champion in a race, or of opening the boot of a classic Rolls-Royce and removing a cold-box packed with chilled champagne. Why do we make up these fantasies? Simply because the reality of motoring rarely lives up to our expectations.
